4. No LLMs were used for this project

# Notes: 
- Input textfiles have white space between every token - I could not figure out how to separate a list of strings any other way in an easy fashion
- Most functions are set up using Either monad, but chain/bind usage was not a concept I could grasp so its use is limited and effectivity of parser is hindered
- Was not able to implement the line number where the error occurs
- Overall I am submitting my best possible work, Racket is a very complex language to understand after only having experience in procedural languages. I appreciate the experience!
